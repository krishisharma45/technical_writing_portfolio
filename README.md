# Technical Writing Portfolio

- introduce yourself and the intent of this portfolio
- give your experience in AI, and the materials you have produced over the course of your career
- talk about your approach to gathering the requirements and writing these samples; "I believe..."
- discuss the three main sections and what they correspond to: 1. publicly available technical writing: your publicly available work, including conference talk outlines, blog posts, and github repos for personal projects  2. samples reflecting the kind of technical writing you've done at the job by are not publicly accessible; emphasize that you made these on your own to reflect what you did on the day to day  3. public videos upi made that capture the nature of internal technical documentation behind a private Confluence and demonstrate your ability to boil down complex jargon

## Private Works

- this is a collection that reflects the type of writing that I have done for internal engineers
- I collaborated with software engineers, key stakeholders and executives to create software documentation on APIs, CLIs, LLMs, and software applications
- these are merely samples of the original work, as the original copies or the property of the companies I had worked for. I have created these samples myself separately and removed any identifying factors of what the original applications were for proprietary reasons.

## Public Works

- this is a collection of works that can be found via the internet

### Conference Talks

- the goal of this body of writing was to give conference members of PyData and PyCon a general idea as to what the talk was going to be about
- the audience was for mainly software developers, data analysts, Python enthusiasts, but also tech adjacent jobs like project managers and HR
- the intention was to attract people interested in topics that I've worked deeply on in the AI industry, sucha as model transparency and data privacy oriented training techniques

### Papers

- the goal of this body of writing was to write for niche audiences

#### Blog Post

- this blog was geared towards non-technical executives that wanted to learn about how they can adopt AI in red-taped industries which have data privacy regulations (such as healthcare and finance)
- the point of the paper was to shed light on an innovative technique developed by Google called Federeated Learning

#### Research Paper

- this paper was written for deeply technical research-oriented people who wanted to learn about how to use Federated Learning in a serverless manner
- the audience was for machine learning engineers and AI researchers who were already familiar with deep learning and wanted to learn more about how to use an open source library, Flower, in a serverless manner (flwr-serverless)

### GitHub Repos

- the goal of this body of work was to provide an overview of the different software packages and applications that I built 
- the main audience was for external users software engineers or students interested in learning how to use or work with the software itself
- the intention was to make it as easy as possible for people to get the application running and provide them with commands to make their life easier using a containerization technology called Docker. Some of the repos include Jupyter notebooks, which have commented sections explaining what the point of each section was

## Technical Videos

- these are videos that I made on my own time as a passion to help new software engineers and students learn more about technologies used on the day to day, without any of the technical jargon that can make the material confusing for new learners
- I wrote the script behind each of these videos and worked to find analogies to simplify some of the concepts 
- the goal was to teach others and to show how these seemingly complex technologies are quite accessible to people who are new to software engineering
- the intended audience was the public: college students, starting software engineers, technical recruiting professionals that want to learn software terms, etc.
