# Technical Writing Portfolio
This portfolio is designed to highlight my technical writing capabilities. I tailor content based on the intended audience. The compilation featured here comes from 4 years of experience in the AI industry. During this time, I wrote several pages of documentation to accomplish different objectives, but because most of that work was for internal use, they are not featured here.

Instead, this portfolio features work that I have created on my own time to show the style of my professional work and work that I created for personal initiatives. These works are split across three main sections:

* [Software Documentation for APIs, LLMs and CLIs](#software-documentation)
* [Software Content for Technical Audiences](#software-content)
* [Software Videos for non-technical audiences](#software-videos)

## Software Documentation
This collection features writing similar to actual documentation that I have produced in collaboration with machine learning engineers, project managers, product owners and executives for APIs, CLIs and LLMs. 

The intention behind these documents, or READMEs, was to communicate the information necessary to quickly get started with using the software application or amend it over time. The main audience was other engineers who were working on the project and non-technical clients that would later use the AI applications.

* [LLM Application](https://github.com/krishisharma45/technical_writing_portfolio/blob/main/software_documentation/llm_application_readme.md)
* [Tensorflow Application](https://github.com/krishisharma45/technical_writing_portfolio/blob/main/software_documentation/tensorflow_application_readme.md)
* [CLI Tool](https://github.com/krishisharma45/technical_writing_portfolio/blob/main/software_documentation/cli_tool_readme.md)
* [API and DB Application](https://github.com/krishisharma45/technical_writing_portfolio/blob/main/software_documentation/api_db_application_readme.md)

## Software Content
This collection features publicly accessible documents that I penned for conferences and papers, as well as for applications that I personally created. 

### Conference Talks
The goal for these submissions was to let technical audience members at Python conferences know what to expect from my talk. The audience included software developers, data analysts, Python enthusiasts and tech adjacent jobs like projects managers and HR.

The intention was to attract people who were interested in learning about AI tools that help with areas that I am passionate about, such as model transparency and data privacy.

### Papers
These following works were written for very different audiences. 

** AI Blog Post **

The blog post below was written for non-technical executives interested in learning more about how to adopt AI in red-taped industries such as healthcare and finance. 

I worked for two years using an innovative technique developed by Google called Federated Learning and wanted to shed light on its ability to bring AI into regulated arenas.

[Innovation in the Age of Regulation: Building AI with Federated Learning](https://www.kungfu.ai/blog-post/innovation-in-the-age-of-regulation-building-ai-with-federated-learning)

** Big Data Scaling Notebook **

This Jupyter notebook was written for students at a machine learning bootcamp that wanted to learn how to use Apache Spark. It is commented to help guide people through the code.

[Data Wrangling at Scale with Apache Spark](https://github.com/krishisharma45/springboard-projects/blob/master/Mini_Project_Data_Wrangling_at_Scale_with_Spark.ipynb)

** AI Research Paper **

The research paper was written for a deeply technical audience including AI researchers and machine learning engineers. I helped edit this research paper and wrote some of the software specific pieces of the research findings conducted by my team.

### Personal Projects
For each software application that I have built on my own time, I have included documentation about how the application was built and how to run the application on a different computer. The main audience was for external users, software engineers or students interested in learning how to build applications using Python and JavaScript.

* [Federated Learning Demo](https://github.com/krishisharma45/federated_learning_demo)
* [MLFlow Demo](https://github.com/krishisharma45/mlflow_hidden_gems)

## Software Videos
After leaving my previous job for a break from software engineering, I made videos about the things that I learned along my software engineering journey. I am passionate about teaching and helping new software engineers and students learn software without dealing with all the jargon.

I wrote the script behind each of these videos and found analogies that helped me understand the concepts when I started out. The intended audience is for anyone with a desire to make life easier with nifty software tools and concepts.
